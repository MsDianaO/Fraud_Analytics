🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Analytics
A graph‑enhanced and gradient‑boosted machine learning project for detecting fraudulent financial transactions using temporal validation, structured preprocessing, relational modeling, and rigorous evaluation.

📂 Project Overview
This project builds, evaluates, and compares multiple fraud‑detection models using the IEEE‑CIS Fraud Detection dataset.
The workflow includes temporal data splitting, extensive preprocessing, graph construction, GNN modeling, XGBoost baselines, and hybrid architectures.

The modeling pipeline evolved through empirical experimentation, ultimately demonstrating that tabular XGBoost models outperform GNN‑only and hybrid models, while GNNs still provide valuable relational insights.

🧹 Data Acquisition & Preparation
Data Source
IEEE‑CIS Fraud Detection dataset (Kaggle)

500k+ transactions across Transaction and Identity tables

Joined using TransactionID

Temporal Split
50/50 time‑based split (train → earlier period, test → future period)

Prevents leakage and mimics real‑world deployment

EDA Highlights
Missingness patterns across identity features

Distribution of TransactionAmt and time deltas

High‑cardinality categorical exploration (emails, cards, devices)

Correlation analysis of masked V/C features

Structural patterns for graph construction (shared cards, devices, IPs)

Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Missing values encoded as explicit categories (no imputation)

Log‑transform applied to TransactionAmt

Cyclical encoding of TransactionDT (sin/cos for hour & day)

Known‑token reduction for emails, devices, and rare categories

Downcasting numeric dtypes for memory efficiency

All categorical features converted to category dtype

Consistent numeric encoding across train/test

🧠 Baseline Model — Logistic Regression
A simple baseline trained on cleaned tabular features.

Performance:

AUC: 0.87

Demonstrated strong predictive signal even without relational modeling

🔗 Graph Construction & GNN Models
Graph Structure
Nodes = transactions

Edges = shared card identifiers (card1, card1+card2)

GraphSAGE Experiments
1 Edge (card1)

AUC: 0.9302

High recall but high false positives

2 Edges (card1 + card2)

AUC: 0.9364

Higher precision, higher recall, fewer false positives

Strongest GNN variant

Ablation Study

Removing V‑features → ~8% performance drop

Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon)

Minimal AUC gain (+0.0001)

Reduced false positives but added instability

Not worth added complexity

⚡ XGBoost — Tabular Baseline
XGBoost delivered the strongest standalone performance.

Results:

AUC: 0.9566

Precision: 0.3352

Recall: 0.8352

False positives cut nearly in half vs. GNNs

Demonstrated that tabular patterns dominate predictive power in this dataset

🧪 Hybrid Models (GNN + XGBoost)
GNN Embeddings + XGBoost
AUC: 0.9524

Precision increased sharply

Recall dropped → more conservative model

GNN + SupCon + XGBoost
AUC: 0.9508

Added complexity without meaningful benefit

Threshold Optimization
Optimal operating point identified at threshold 0.6450:

Precision: 0.7121

Recall: 0.7002

Balanced tradeoff for real‑world fraud operations.

🖥️ User Interface (Streamlit)
The final Streamlit dashboard includes:

Transaction lookup by TransactionID

Fraud probability score from the hybrid model

Threshold slider for dynamic decisioning

Clean, user‑centric layout with real test‑set data
